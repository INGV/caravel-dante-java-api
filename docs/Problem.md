# Problem

This schema describes RFC7807 Problem Details for HTTP APIs. The specification is intentionally flexible, and allows to adapt the schema adding further properties, or not enforcing any of the properties below.  To make this schema safe by default, additionalProperties are forbidden though. In case you need them, you can either re-define Problem or extend it using `allOf`.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**detail** | **String** | A human readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem. You MUST NOT expose internal informations, personal data or implementation details through this field.  &#x60;detail&#x60; supports localized patterns whereas &#x60;title&#x60; pattern is only in ascii.  |  [optional] |
|**instance** | **URI** | An absolute URI that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem. It may or may not yield further information if dereferenced.  |  [optional] |
|**status** | **Integer** | The HTTP status code generated by the origin server for this occurrence of the problem.  |  [optional] |
|**title** | **String** | A short, summary of the problem type. Written in english and readable for engineers (usually not suited for non technical stakeholders and not localized): the expressed pattern does not support unicode characters.  |  [optional] |
|**type** | **URI** | An absolute URI that identifies the problem type.  When dereferenced, it SHOULD provide human-readable documentation for the problem type (e.g., using HTML).  |  [optional] |
